# Human-following-hexa-rotor-with-obstacle-avoidance-using-YoloV3-and-StereoVision
## Implemented YoloV3 in a hexa-rotor to make it follow humans and the hexa-rotor avoids obstacles by turning the desired velocity vector into V_x, V_y and V_z when the human detection camera detects the human and the 6 cameras placed for obstacle avoidance using disparity maps detect any obstacles. We used a pixhawk to
give the desired velocity vectors to the drone. Developed a autonomous precision landing method using Pyzbar and dronekit library to detect the QR code and land on it precisely.
